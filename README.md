# Control Flow (WIP)

A library for properties of graphs that are useful. Mostly focusing control flow
graphs.

Currently that means (some are more complete than others):
- Directed, Undirected, and Flow Graphs
- Paths and Reachability
- Algorithms for finding paths and reachability
- Kildall's worklist algorithm for dataflow analysis
- Dominance Relations
- Algorithm for computing dominance sets
- Properties of DAGs
- Trees
