# Control Flow (WIP)

A library for properties of control flow graphs that are useful.

Currently that means:
- A definition for directed-graphs and an implementation
- A definition for paths (all vertices are distinct in this version)
- A function for finding a path between two vertices
- The start of defining dominance relations
